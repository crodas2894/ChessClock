# ChessClock
For this digital chess clock I created a debouncer, a seven segment decoder, a clock divider, and a main fsm code. The fsm was the main controller of the whole project. The fsm consisted of 19 states. I had to use a clock divider to achieve the proper frequencies needed to run this digital chess clock. The boardâ€™s default clock frequency is 100 MHz so I had to put that through a clock divider that produce a 1 Hz signal(done to achieve a one second delay) and a 50 MHz clock pulse in order to keep our seven segment displays actively displaying. Aside from the main fsm I had to create a case statement to control all the displaying values and times that would be displayed on the seven segment displays. I worked with integer values to keep it simple and converted these integer values into 16 bit binary numbers to be decoded in order to have the correct seven segment value displayed. I used division and modulo in order to take our 16 bit number and get the proper 7 bit number to be decoded into our seven segment display. The separate decoder would take two 16 bit numbers and output 8 7 bit decoded seven segment display values. This whole project was implemented on a Zedboard.
